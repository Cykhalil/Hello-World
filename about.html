          <h1>Hello, welcome to my site.</h1>
          <p>My name is Sanaa Khalil. I always loved reading Interior Design magazines when I was young, and they were the number one item on my packing list for travel. I have liked to sketch new possible space layouts for the house in which I grew up as well as the houses of my relatives and friends. I left my Public Relations career in order to professionally fulfill my passion for interior design. I completed my Diploma in Interior Design with The Interior Design Institute in Vancouver in 2021. It was a terrific journey. It helped me learn much content and gain more experience and confidence in my abilities to build designs. I believe the Interior Design program has a wonderful therapeutic benefit which helped me deal with the loss of my father.</p>
